## Tips

* For convenience choose your primary target device and create layout for that device first after that add classes to make it responsive for other devices.

*  There is no need to customize the layout for extra small devices like mobile phones; since columns on extra small devices are always horizontal and rendered as one column grid layout by default.

* Tip: You can use the Bootstrap list group component for creating sidebar navigation. For example, displaying the list of product or categories on your website.
